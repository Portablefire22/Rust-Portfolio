# Huh?

Thought I should probably work and something useful, so I decided to make a portfolio website. 
It also allows me to boost my ego by showing off my work :3 

The hope is to host this website :3

### Running

```bash
trunk serve
```

Rebuilds the app whenever a change is detected and runs a local server to host it.

There's also the `trunk watch` command which does the same thing but without hosting it.

### Release

```bash
trunk build --release
```

This builds the app in release mode similar to `cargo build --release`.
You can also pass the `--release` flag to `trunk serve` if you need to get every last drop of performance.

Unless overwritten, the output will be located in the `dist` directory.
